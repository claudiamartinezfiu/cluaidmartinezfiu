My personal repository

I'm a highly motivated person interested in growing in the professional world and spand my knowledge as much as possible.
I'm currenlty working as the Director of Revenue Management for a property management company based in Miami. I love what I do, and I love Computer Science.
I know there is so much I can achieve my merging these 2 worlds and that's my goal in the next 2 years.

I expect to be able to work on a project that will allow Revenue Managers to better control the properties with tools that would make a property more profitable by automating actions that would take too much time and effor for a person to do.

On a more personal aspect; I love cooking, that's my way of making my close ones happy!
